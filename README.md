# SortingAlgos
 A collection of 10 commonly used sorting algorithms implemented in Java.

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Counting Sort
8. Shell Sort
9. Radix Sort
10. Bucket Sort

Note: We will see sorting algorthmes to sort in ascending order.

### 1. Bubble Sort
##### Intuition: 
**Bubble the largest of the two elements towards the end of the array.** 
Repeat the bubbling process for all the elements.
Decrement the pointer to the end of the array by one and start over. Stop when end pointer is at first element.

##### Time Complexity: 
O(n^2)

### 2. Selection Sort
##### Intuition:
**Select the smallest element in the array and move it to start of the array.**
Increment the pointer to the start of array by one and start over. Stop when start pointer is at last element.

##### Time Complexity: 
O(n^2)
